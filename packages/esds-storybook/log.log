Important notice: Your Applitools visual tests are currently running with a concurrency value of 10.
This means that only up to 10 visual tests can run in parallel, and therefore the execution might be slower.
If your Applitools license supports a higher concurrency level, learn how to configure it here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@applitools/eyes-storybook#concurrency.
Need a higher concurrency in your account? Email us @ sdr@applitools.com with your required concurrency level.
